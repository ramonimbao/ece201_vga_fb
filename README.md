# ECE 201 FPGA Final Project

This project demonstrates an analog clock displayed through VGA.

The display is 640×480 but consists of a 240×240 (scaled to 2×) frame buffer to limit the amount of 'memory' used.

Designed for the [Intel (formerly Terasic) DE1 board](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/solutions/partners/partner-profile/terasic-inc-/board/altera-de1-board.html).
